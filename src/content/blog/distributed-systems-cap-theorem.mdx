# Understanding Distributed Systems: CAP Theorem and Beyond

Distributed systems are the backbone of modern computing. From cloud services to blockchain networks, understanding the fundamental principles that govern these systems is crucial for any engineer working at scale.

## The CAP Theorem: A Foundation

The CAP theorem, formulated by Eric Brewer, states that in a distributed system, you can only guarantee two out of three properties:

- **Consistency**: All nodes see the same data at the same time
- **Availability**: The system remains operational
- **Partition Tolerance**: The system continues to function despite network failures

### Understanding Each Property

#### Consistency
Consistency means that all nodes in the system have the same view of the data. When you write data to one node, all other nodes should immediately reflect that change.

```python
# Example of strong consistency
class ConsistentStore:
    def __init__(self, nodes):
        self.nodes = nodes
    
    def write(self, key, value):
        # Write to all nodes before returning success
        for node in self.nodes:
            if not node.write(key, value):
                # If any node fails, rollback all writes
                self.rollback(key)
                return False
        return True
```

#### Availability
Availability means the system remains operational and can respond to requests, even if some nodes are down.

```python
# Example of high availability
class AvailableStore:
    def __init__(self, nodes):
        self.nodes = nodes
    
    def read(self, key):
        # Try to read from any available node
        for node in self.nodes:
            try:
                return node.read(key)
            except NodeUnavailableError:
                continue
        raise ServiceUnavailableError("All nodes unavailable")
```

#### Partition Tolerance
Partition tolerance means the system can handle network splits where nodes can't communicate with each other.

## Real-World Examples

### CP Systems (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)

**Examples**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB (with strong consistency), HBase

```python
# MongoDB with strong consistency
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client.mydb

# Write concern ensures consistency
result = db.users.insert_one(
    {"name": "John", "email": "john@example.com"},
    write_concern={"w": "majority", "j": True}
)
```

### AP Systems (Availability + Partition Tolerance)

**Examples**: Cassandra, DynamoDB, CouchDB

```python
# Cassandra example
from cassandra.cluster import Cluster

cluster = Cluster(['127.0.0.1'])
session = cluster.connect()

# Eventually consistent read
rows = session.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,))
```

### CA Systems (Consistency + Availability)

**Examples**: Traditional single-node databases, Redis (single instance)

```python
# Redis single instance
import redis

r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

# Strong consistency within single node
r.set('key', 'value')
value = r.get('key')
```

## Beyond CAP: Modern Considerations

### PACELC Theorem

The PACELC theorem extends CAP by considering what happens during normal operation:

- **P**: Partition tolerance
- **A**: Availability vs Consistency during partition
- **C**: Consistency
- **E**: Else (normal operation)
- **L**: Latency
- **C**: Consistency vs Latency during normal operation

### BASE Properties

BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) describes the properties of many modern distributed systems:

```python
# Eventual consistency example
class EventuallyConsistentStore:
    def __init__(self):
        self.local_cache = {}
        self.replication_queue = []
    
    def write(self, key, value):
        # Write locally immediately (available)
        self.local_cache[key] = value
        
        # Queue for replication (eventual consistency)
        self.replication_queue.append((key, value))
        
        # Asynchronously replicate to other nodes
        self.async_replicate()
```

## Consensus Algorithms

### Raft Algorithm

Raft is a consensus algorithm designed to be understandable. It elects a leader that handles all client requests.

```python
# Simplified Raft implementation
class RaftNode:
    def __init__(self, node_id, peers):
        self.node_id = node_id
        self.peers = peers
        self.state = 'follower'
        self.current_term = 0
        self.voted_for = None
        self.log = []
    
    def request_vote(self, candidate_id, term, last_log_index, last_log_term):
        if term > self.current_term:
            self.current_term = term
            self.voted_for = candidate_id
            return True
        return False
    
    def append_entries(self, leader_id, term, prev_log_index, entries, leader_commit):
        if term >= self.current_term:
            self.current_term = term
            self.leader_id = leader_id
            
            # Append entries to log
            if self.log_consistency_check(prev_log_index):
                self.log.extend(entries)
                return True
        return False
```

### Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)

PBFT handles Byzantine failures where nodes can behave maliciously.

```python
# PBFT message types
class PBFTMessage:
    def __init__(self, message_type, view, sequence, content):
        self.message_type = message_type  # PRE-PREPARE, PREPARE, COMMIT
        self.view = view
        self.sequence = sequence
        self.content = content
        self.sender = None

class PBFTNode:
    def __init__(self, node_id, total_nodes):
        self.node_id = node_id
        self.total_nodes = total_nodes
        self.faulty_nodes = (total_nodes - 1) // 3
        self.view = 0
        self.sequence = 0
    
    def pre_prepare(self, request):
        # Primary sends pre-prepare message
        message = PBFTMessage('PRE-PREPARE', self.view, self.sequence, request)
        self.broadcast(message)
    
    def prepare(self, pre_prepare_msg):
        # Backup nodes send prepare messages
        message = PBFTMessage('PREPARE', self.view, self.sequence, pre_prepare_msg.content)
        self.broadcast(message)
    
    def commit(self, prepare_msgs):
        # Send commit when 2f+1 prepare messages received
        if len(prepare_msgs) >= 2 * self.faulty_nodes + 1:
            message = PBFTMessage('COMMIT', self.view, self.sequence, prepare_msgs[0].content)
            self.broadcast(message)
```

## Distributed Data Patterns

### Sharding Strategies

Sharding distributes data across multiple nodes:

```python
# Consistent hashing for sharding
import hashlib

class ConsistentHashSharding:
    def __init__(self, nodes):
        self.nodes = nodes
        self.ring = {}
        self.setup_ring()
    
    def setup_ring(self):
        for node in self.nodes:
            # Add multiple virtual nodes for better distribution
            for i in range(100):
                virtual_node = f"{node}:{i}"
                hash_key = self.hash(virtual_node)
                self.ring[hash_key] = node
    
    def hash(self, key):
        return int(hashlib.md5(key.encode()).hexdigest(), 16)
    
    def get_node(self, key):
        hash_key = self.hash(key)
        sorted_keys = sorted(self.ring.keys())
        
        for ring_key in sorted_keys:
            if ring_key >= hash_key:
                return self.ring[ring_key]
        
        # Wrap around to first node
        return self.ring[sorted_keys[0]]
```

### Replication Strategies

#### Master-Slave Replication

```python
class MasterSlaveReplication:
    def __init__(self, master, slaves):
        self.master = master
        self.slaves = slaves
    
    def write(self, key, value):
        # Write to master
        result = self.master.write(key, value)
        
        # Replicate to slaves asynchronously
        for slave in self.slaves:
            slave.async_replicate(key, value)
        
        return result
    
    def read(self, key):
        # Read from master for consistency
        return self.master.read(key)
```

#### Multi-Master Replication

```python
class MultiMasterReplication:
    def __init__(self, masters):
        self.masters = masters
        self.conflict_resolver = ConflictResolver()
    
    def write(self, key, value, timestamp=None):
        if timestamp is None:
            timestamp = time.time()
        
        # Write to all masters
        results = []
        for master in self.masters:
            result = master.write(key, value, timestamp)
            results.append(result)
        
        # Resolve conflicts if any
        return self.conflict_resolver.resolve(results)
```

## Monitoring Distributed Systems

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Latency**: P50, P95, P99 response times
2. **Throughput**: Requests per second
3. **Error Rates**: 4xx and 5xx responses
4. **Availability**: Uptime percentage
5. **Consistency**: Data consistency metrics

```python
# Distributed system monitoring
class DistributedSystemMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = {
            'latency': Histogram('request_latency_seconds'),
            'throughput': Counter('requests_total'),
            'errors': Counter('errors_total'),
            'availability': Gauge('system_availability')
        }
    
    def record_request(self, duration, success):
        self.metrics['latency'].observe(duration)
        self.metrics['throughput'].inc()
        
        if not success:
            self.metrics['errors'].inc()
    
    def check_consistency(self, nodes):
        # Check data consistency across nodes
        consistency_score = self.calculate_consistency(nodes)
        return consistency_score
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Design for Failure

Assume everything will fail:

```python
# Circuit breaker pattern
class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, timeout=60):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.state = 'CLOSED'  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
    
    def call(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.state == 'OPEN':
            if time.time() - self.last_failure_time > self.timeout:
                self.state = 'HALF_OPEN'
            else:
                raise CircuitBreakerOpenError()
        
        try:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            self.on_success()
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self.on_failure()
            raise e
    
    def on_success(self):
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.state = 'CLOSED'
    
    def on_failure(self):
        self.failure_count += 1
        self.last_failure_time = time.time()
        
        if self.failure_count >= self.failure_threshold:
            self.state = 'OPEN'
```

### 2. Implement Proper Timeouts

```python
# Timeout decorator
import signal
from functools import wraps

def timeout(seconds):
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            def timeout_handler(signum, frame):
                raise TimeoutError(f"Function {func.__name__} timed out")
            
            signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, timeout_handler)
            signal.alarm(seconds)
            
            try:
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                return result
            finally:
                signal.alarm(0)
        
        return wrapper
    return decorator

# Usage
@timeout(5)
def call_external_service():
    # This will timeout after 5 seconds
    return external_api_call()
```

### 3. Use Idempotent Operations

```python
# Idempotent write operation
class IdempotentWriter:
    def __init__(self, storage):
        self.storage = storage
    
    def write(self, key, value, operation_id):
        # Check if operation already completed
        if self.storage.get(f"op:{operation_id}"):
            return self.storage.get(key)
        
        # Perform write
        result = self.storage.set(key, value)
        
        # Mark operation as completed
        self.storage.set(f"op:{operation_id}", "completed")
        
        return result
```

## Conclusion

Understanding distributed systems is essential for building scalable, reliable applications. The CAP theorem provides a foundation, but modern systems require deeper understanding of consensus algorithms, replication strategies, and failure handling.

Key takeaways:

1. **Choose your trade-offs wisely**: Understand what you're sacrificing for consistency, availability, or partition tolerance
2. **Design for failure**: Assume components will fail and plan accordingly
3. **Monitor everything**: Distributed systems are complex; comprehensive monitoring is crucial
4. **Start simple**: Begin with proven patterns and evolve as needed

The distributed systems landscape continues to evolve, with new algorithms and patterns emerging regularly. Stay curious, experiment with different approaches, and always consider the trade-offs.
